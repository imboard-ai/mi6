## Why Prompts?

While dossiers automate **project operations** (setup, tasks, worktrees), prompts will help with **code operations** (writing, reviewing, refactoring code).

**Example**:
```
Use MI6 code-review prompt to review this PR:
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Validate error handling
- Verify test coverage
- Suggest improvements
```

## Community Contributions Welcome!

Have effective prompts for AI assistants?

**We'd love**:
- Prompts that work well with Claude, GPT-4, Cursor, Copilot
- Proven patterns from real projects

- Language-specific prompts (TypeScript, Python, Go, etc.)

**Submit**:
- Create PR with your prompt
