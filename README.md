# 🕵️‍♂️ MI6 — The Agent Organization for Developers

**MI6** is an **open meta-framework for agent-driven development**, built and maintained by [ImBoard.ai](https://imboard.ai).

It provides a reusable foundation for coordinating **human and AI agents** across multi-repository environments — enabling structure, context control, and automation in modern development workflows.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional development frameworks manage **code**.  
**MI6** manages the **intelligence around code** — the tasks, prompts, workflows, and context that allow both humans and AI agents to collaborate effectively.

### ✳️ Core Ideas

- **Agent-driven workflows** — structure how humans and AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) operate together.
- **Context hygiene** — keep AI tools focused by defining what’s in-scope via `.aicontextignore` and metadata files.
- **Reusable infrastructure** — scripts, templates, and validation workflows shared across all your projects.
- **Multi-repo orchestration** — connect backend, frontend, docs, and automation repos cleanly.
- **Task lifecycle clarity** — standardize how work moves from `planned → active → stashed → completed`.

## 📂 Repository Structure

MI6 is organized into focused directories, each with comprehensive documentation:

| Directory | Purpose | Explore |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **[scripts/](./scripts/)** | Shell & Node.js automation tools for fast, deterministic operations | [📖 README](./scripts/README.md) |
| **[dossiers/](./dossiers/)** | LLM-guided intelligent automation with self-improving protocol | [📖 README](./dossiers/README.md) |
| **[workflows/](./workflows/)** | Documented operational patterns and best practices | [📖 README](./workflows/README.md) |
| **[templates/](./templates/)** | Project scaffolds and configuration templates | [📖 README](./templates/README.md) |
| **[docs/](./docs/)** | Comprehensive guides, references, and philosophy | [📖 README](./docs/README.md) |
| **[prompts/](./prompts/)** | AI assistant prompt library (planned) | [📖 README](./prompts/README.md) |

💡 **Quick navigation**: Each directory contains a README explaining its contents, usage patterns, and integration with other MI6 components.

## 🧠 Why MI6 Exists

> “The future of software isn’t just code — it’s collaboration between humans and intelligent agents.”

Teams are already using AI tools for code generation, documentation, and planning — but without structure, the results are chaotic.  
MI6 introduces **a layer of discipline**: a standardized way to manage context, share agent prompts, and coordinate automation across multiple projects.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

MI6 supports two user profiles:

### 🛠️ MI6-Operator (Contributors)

**For those developing MI6 itself:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/imboard-ai/mi6.git ~/projects/mi6

# Run environment setup
cd ~/projects/mi6/scripts/admin
./setup-env.sh

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

# Verify setup
./verify-setup.sh

# Start contributing!
```

### 👤 MI6-Citizen (Users)

**For those using MI6 in their projects:**

**Option A - Local Installation** (recommended):
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/imboard-ai/mi6.git ~/projects/mi6
cd ~/projects/mi6/scripts/admin && ./setup-env.sh
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

# Use MI6 resources
cp $MI6_PATH/templates/AI_GUIDE.md my-project/
cp $MI6_PATH/templates/.ai-project.json my-project/
```

**Option B - Direct GitHub Reference** (no local clone):
```bash
# Download templates on-demand
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imboard-ai/mi6/main/templates/AI_GUIDE.md > AI_GUIDE.md

# Use scripts directly
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imboard-ai/mi6/main/scripts/task-manager/task-manager.js | node -
```

📚 **Detailed setup guide**: [docs/environment-setup.md](./docs/environment-setup.md)

## 🤖 Agentic Automation (Dossiers)

MI6 leverages the fact that users have access to LLM agents. Instead of complex scripts, MI6 provides **dossiers** - intelligent instruction sets that AI agents execute.

### What Are Dossiers?

Dossiers are structured markdown files that tell LLM agents (Claude, GPT-4, Cursor, Copilot) exactly how to automate complex tasks intelligently.

**Example**:
```
"Use the MI6 project-init dossier to set up this directory"
```

The AI agent reads `$MI6_PATH/dossiers/project-init.md` and:
- Detects your project structure (single/multi/mono repo)
- Identifies tech stack (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Copies and customizes all templates
- Sets up task management
- Initializes everything perfectly

### Available Dossiers

| Dossier | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **project-init.md** | Initialize new MI6 project (replaces complex setup wizard) |
| **worktree-multi-repo.md** | Create linked worktrees across multiple repos |
| **worktree-cleanup.md** | Safely remove worktrees when feature work is complete |
| **task-create.md** | Generate structured task documents |

📚 **Learn more**: [dossiers/README.md](./dossiers/README.md)

### Worktree Scripts (Hybrid Automation)

For fast deterministic execution, MI6 also provides traditional shell scripts:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **create-feature-worktree.sh** | Create worktrees (reads `.ai-project.json`) |
| **list-worktrees.sh** | Show all active worktrees with status |
| **cleanup-worktree.sh** | Remove worktrees safely |

```bash
# Quick worktree workflow
$MI6_PATH/scripts/worktree/create-feature-worktree.sh my-feature
$MI6_PATH/scripts/worktree/list-worktrees.sh
$MI6_PATH/scripts/worktree/cleanup-worktree.sh my-feature
```

📚 **Learn more**: [scripts/worktree/README.md](./scripts/worktree/README.md)

### Why Dossiers?

- ✅ **Adaptive**: LLMs understand your project context
- ✅ **Simpler**: Markdown instructions vs complex shell scripts
- ✅ **Powerful**: Handles edge cases through intelligence
- ✅ **Extensible**: Anyone can write dossiers
